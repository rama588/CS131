ASSIGNMENT 3

#TASK 1
#Each student's total score is calculated and stored in the associative array total_scores[]

#TASK 2
#A user-defined function (calc_avg) is used to compute the average score. Based on the average, students are classified as "Pass" (avg â‰¥ 70) or "Fail". Results are stored in avg_scores[] and pass_status[] associative arrays.

#TASK 3
#The script keeps track of the highest and lowest total scores using two variables: max_total and min_total. The corresponding student names are stored in top_stu and bot_stu.

#TASK 4
#Each block includes the student's name, total score, rounded average score, and if they failed or passed. Student order below is based on how awk iterates over the associative array.
